    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fry an egg, melt the cheese, and warm your tortilla all in the same pan. Add your favorite toppings-like salsa, jalape√±o pepper slices, cilantro, and green onions-and enjoy a great tasting breakfast, done in a flash. Of course, you can repeat, as many times as you like if you have company.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon taco seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 1/2 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (6 to 7-inch) flour tortilla</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat, and swirl the pan to coat the bottom evenly.</li>
        <li>Carefully break the egg into the buttered skillet and cook until the egg white is opaque and the egg is firm enough to turn, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Turn the egg over, being careful not to break the yolk; sprinkle with taco seasoning and about half of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Gently place the tortilla over the egg and cheese, and cook about 1 minute. Using a silicone egg turner, flip the egg and tortilla together.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the egg, and continue cooking until the egg is done to your liking and the tortilla is warm and toasty, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slide the tortilla and egg onto a serving plate and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
